<a name="API"></a>

We are working on apiary descriptions for the API methods, that will come soon ...

A description of "plain" rules can be found at [plain rules](plain_rules.md).

Visual Rules are intended to be used by the Portal exclusively, until a new format is developed which will replace the
old format eventually. So, basically, the DCA's documentation is the reference.

Notices/notifications follow the format defined in Orion (Context Broker) for "notify" actions.
[Context subscriptions](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/walkthrough_apiv2/index.html#subscriptions)

## API

All HTTP request must have `application/json` as MIME type. Responses are `application/json` also. Generally, the JSON
returned as response includes a `error` field with a string describing an error or `null` if everything worked fine.

Every request should send a field header for the service (`Fiware-Service`) and the subservice (`Fiware-ServicePath`) it
refers to.

For service and servicepath only alphanumeric and underscore characters are allowed.

The servicepath is a set of scopes separated by "/" and has the following limitations:

-   each scope must start with "/"
-   10 maximum scope levels in a path
-   50 maximum characters in each level, only alphanum and underscore allowed
-   Empty scopes are not allowed, at least it has to have length 1 (excluding the "/")

Fiware-ServicePath is an optional header. It is assumed that requests without Fiware-ServicePath belongs to a root scope
"/" implicitely.

Internally to the CEP, scopes do not have a special meaning, so the entire servicepath string is used as a unit, and no
operation of CEP takes into account a particular scope inside servicepath. Note this is the current behaviour, although
it could change in the future to align more closely to how Orion uses service path (i.e. in a hierarchical way)

### Pagination

Perseo-fe implements a pagination mechanism in order to help clients to retrieve large sets of resources. This mechanism
works for all listing operations in the API (GET /rules, GET /vrules)

The mechanism is based on three URI parameters:

-   **limit**: in order to specify the maximum number of elements (default is 20, maximum allowed is 1000).
-   **offset**: in order to skip a given number of elements at the beginning (default is 0)
-   **count** (as option): if activated then a Fiware-Total-Count header is added to the response, with a count of total
    elements.
